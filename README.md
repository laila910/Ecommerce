## steps

1. Via Composer Create-Project `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel:^7.0 Ecommerce`

2. installing laravel/ui package `composer require laravel/ui:^2.4`

3. Once the laravel/ui package has been installed, you may install the frontend scaffolding using the ui Artisan command:
// Generate login / registration scaffolding...
`php artisan ui vue --auth`

4. for compile Your fresh scaffolding run this command and run all mix tasks... `npm run dev`

5. should install laravel-mix package `npm install laravel-mix@latest` and re-run step 4

6. I have a problem that Node_Modules doesn't exist so I had to run this command `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server` and re-run step 4

7. I got this error `
i Compiling Mix
âˆš Mix: Compiled with some errors in 2.74s

webpack compiled with 1 error and 1 warning`

8. to solve it open file webpack.mix.js : and add this `mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js').vue()
    .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');`

9. Additional dependencies must be installes `npm install vue-loader@^15.9.7 --save-dev --legacy-peer-deps` and re-run `npm run dev`

10. I got this error : `cannot find module 'webpack/lib/rules/descriptiondatamatcherruleplugin'`

11. to solve it Run this command `npm update vue-loader` and re-run `npm run dev`

12. finally Laravel Mix is compliled Successfully with `1 warning in child compilations (Use 'stats.children: true' resp. '--stats-children' for more details) webpack compiled with 1 warning`

13. you can keep going or try to fix this warning  by adding this to webpack.mix.js: `mix.webpackConfig({ stats: { children: true }});`
